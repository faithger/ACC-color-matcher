The following code lets you calculate the closest color that is available in ACC, to a random color you've chosen for your car, from a color template. 
This dosn't account for things like Metalic etc.. To execute this code you can use an online compiler like "OneCompiler". 
This isn't in a .py format or anthing like that, becuase it's for a community that isn't too much fokused on programing.
